# Task 1   
1. A program, which counts from 1 to 'n' numbers, was coded in C language and was run using gcc compiler.

The code is as follows:
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int i, sum = 0, n = 60;
    for (i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        sum += i;
    }
    printf("Sum of number from 1 to %d is %d\n", n, sum);
    return 0;
}
```

  The output was run using ./a.out
