<summary><b>Task 1: </b> Installing all essential tools and compiling a 'C' code using gcc compiler.</summary>
<br>
    
1. A program, which counts from 1 to 'n' numbers, was coded in C language and was run using gcc compiler.

The code is as follows:
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int i, sum = 0, n = 60;
    for (i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        sum += i;
    }
    printf("Sum of number from 1 to %d is %d\n", n, sum);
    return 0;
}
```

  The output was run using ./a.out

1. The 'C' program code (Sum of 1 to n numbers) was run using riscv architecture using a spike simulator and output was obtained.

   ![Task2 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/318835d9-7191-4084-ac8d-b16bca51c9a9)

2. The object dump of the riscv architecture was opened and debugging was done using spike.
3. The program counter (pc) was run till a certain instruction and it was manually run after that for debugging. 
   Each instruction was run by clicking enter each time.

4. The contents of the Stack Pointer(SP) register was observed. The stack pointer register(SP) instruction was run and the contents of the SP were looked at again.

<summary><b>Task 3: </b>Understanding and identifying different instruction types (R, I, S, B, U, J).</summary> 
<br>

## Instructions:
Instructions are a set of machine language instructions that a particular processor understands and executes. A processor performs tasks on the basis of the instruction provided.
An instruction comprises of groups called fields. These fields include:
* The Operation code (Opcode) field which specifies the operation to be performed.
* The Address field which contains the location of the operand, i.e., register or memory location.
* The Mode field which specifies how the operand will be located.

  
The RISC-V instructions are categorized into **6** types based on their field organization. The types include:
- **R-type**: Register type
- **I-type**: Immediate type
- **S-type**: Store type
- **B-type**: Branch type
- **U-type**: Upper immediate type
- **J-type**: Jump type

Lets discuss one by one:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 1. R-Type Instruction:

![R type](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7aefa71e-76ba-43c5-9e8c-b5dbb54559b4)

R-type instructions are one of the six types of instructions in RISC-V's RV32I instruction set.
It is a register-register instruction that uses registers for both the source and destination.
R-type instructions are used for arithmetic and logic operations.
It specifies the two operands and the destination of the result using register file locations.
The R-type instruction has multiple fields, including: 
* The opcode field : Tells the processor what operation to perform.
* The destination register operand (rd): The register which stores the result of the operation.
* Source register operands (rs1, rs2): The registers where the input is stored.
* 'funct3' field: It is the field after the destination register . This field is 3 â€“ bit length     i.e. from bit 12 to bit 14 and it further tells about the operation, such as whether it is an     addition, subtraction, or a logical operation that is being performed.
* 'funct7' field: It is the last field of R -type instruction format . It describes the              operation, such as whether it is a shift or multiplication operation etc.

## 2. I-Type Instruction:
